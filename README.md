# ⚽ FIFA Player Data Analysis using Seaborn & Pandas

This project presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on FIFA player statistics using **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas**. The goal is to uncover insights from player attributes through compelling visualizations and statistical exploration.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Perform data wrangling and cleaning on the FIFA dataset.
- Visualize player attributes to understand distribution and correlations.
- Analyze key features such as:
  - Age, nationality, and overall ratings.
  - Player positions and performance metrics.
  - Value, wage, and potential ratings.
- Use **Seaborn** for insightful and interactive visual storytelling.

---

## 📊 Key Libraries

- `pandas` — data handling and preprocessing.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` — data visualization.
- `warnings` — to suppress irrelevant warnings for clean output.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes various attributes for professional football players such as:

- **Player Name, Nationality, Age**
- **Overall Rating, Potential, Value, Wage**
- **Skill metrics** (e.g., Pace, Shooting, Passing)
- **Position-based analysis**

---

## 📈 Analysis Highlights

- **Age Distribution**: Identifies peak age group in professional football.
- **Overall Ratings**: Assesses skill level distribution across players.
- **Top 10 Countries**: Nations with the most players in the dataset.
- **Wage vs. Value**: Correlation between players’ financials and performance.
- **Position Analysis**: Insights into different playing roles and their attributes.

### 📷 Sample Visualizations
